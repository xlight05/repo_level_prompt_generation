The gloo.txmgr.file subsystem provides a file based implementation of
the gloo.txmgr subsystem.
<p>A transaction log consists of a sequence of xxxxxxxx.tlog files
stored in the namespace directory. The xxxxx number is the transaction
log version at which the log started. Each time a snapshot is taken a
new transaction log file is created based on the latest version of the
managed object.</p>
<p>Each file contains the serialized managed object followed by all
the write transactions that changed the managed object state. The
current state of the managed object is restored by applying all
transactions to the initial state.</p>
<p>The behaviour of the FileTxLog is specified using a
FileTxLogConfiguration:
<ul>
	<li>The tx file name format. Default is %028d.</li>
	<li>The tx file extension. Default is .tlog .</li>
	<li>The namespace. The namespace is the base directory where the
	transaction log is stored.</li>
	<li>The input and output ciphers used to access the transaction
	log.</li>
</ul>
