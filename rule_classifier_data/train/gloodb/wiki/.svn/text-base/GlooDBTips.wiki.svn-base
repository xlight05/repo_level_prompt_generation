= Common Mistakes =

 == Embedded Value ==
 # Embedded value is reset after updating the object.
  ** The embedded value is not cloned correctly. Check the clone method
 # Embedded value is not flushed in !PostUpdate / !PostCreate
  ** Use !PreCreate or !PreUpdate to flush the embedded value instead of Post callbacks (at post time the embedded value has been persisted already and reset to not-fetched not-dirty).

== Association ==
 # Cannot find and object in a collection of objects (contains returns false) returned from an association.
  ** Implement the equal method for the object which compares object identities to establish equality.
