The gloo.file.storage.block subsystem provides a file based implementation of
the gloo.storage subsystem. Objects are serialized, then their serial form
is broken down into blocks of equal size. The blocks are written in a physical
file. The ordered list of file offsets for each block makes the address of 
the object. To restore, the blocks are retrieved from the file based on 
the provided address, then the serial form of the object is assembled. 
The object is the restored from its serial form.
