<h1>Iteration Retrospective - #0/1</h1>
<strong><p>Team - Full Timers</p>
<p>Meeting Date - Wednesday 11 October, 2006</p></strong>
</div>
<br/>
<h2>Major Achievements / Challenges Overcome</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Set up of the build process</li>
	<li>Initial GUI design implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>Little else was achieved and iteration 1 was not really achieved.</p>

<h2>Significant choices / Decisions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Swing was chosen as the GUI library.</li>
	<li>JFreeChart was chosen over RRD due to ease of use and known functionality that is required for the Metric Tool.</li>
	<li>Decision to use TortoiseSVN instead of Subclipse</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is working well?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Tortoise & SVN have been working smoothly apart from Swinburne wireless firewall problems.</li>
	<li>Xstreme has been found to be easy to use and work with</li>
	<li>JFreeChart has also been found to be very easy to produce charts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Challenges</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Communication</strong>: the most significant issue for the team at the moment is the lack of communication
	and insufficient team meetings. This has been made obvious through the lack of progress</li>
	<li><strong>Code Integration</strong>: the team now has several pieces of code that cover most of
	the user stories, however they are not linked together properly</li>
	<li><strong>Google Code Speed</strong> has been found to be slower than anticipated hence it
	can only really be used for source control and not maintaining large libraries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>The only significant risk currently is team motivation</p>
