1 Spike Outcomes Template
Spike outcomes
Subclipse worked with out problems and provided the ability to commit and update code.

GoalRisk
The risk is that the development team do not have sufficient confidence in the technology Subversion to handle code versioning properly. The goal is to better understand how Subversion works.
