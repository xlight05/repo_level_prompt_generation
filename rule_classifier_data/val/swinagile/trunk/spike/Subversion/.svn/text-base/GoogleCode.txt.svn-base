Spike Plan											
Name: Google Code Repository

CVS Module/Location: None

Overview
This spike is being undertaken on the grounds that the team has limited knowledge regarding Google code repository.

Background/Context:
This spike was planned because of a lack of a code repository. This code repository is a necessary component of an effective IT team and should be available.

Goals/Risks:
The goal of this spike is to prove that a code repository is possible with Google, Subversion and team members with limited Subversion/CVS experience. Use of a code repository increases productivity and reduces the risk of inconsistent releases.

Deliverables:
There will be created a How To document about utilising Subversion to connect to an established source repository. Finished Date: Tuesday, August 29, 2006.

Resources: Ben Hall (1845454)

Deadline: Wednesday, 30th August

Analysis/Planning/Design notes
-	Google Code requires an account with Google.
-	TortoiseSVN seems to be a viable option for connection to Google Code repository.
-	Additional feature: Issues logger.
-	Available technology freely available.


Spike outcomes										
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal/Risk:
The goal of this spike is to prove that a code repository is possible with Google, Subversion and team members with limited Subversion/CVS experience. The goal is to determine the 

Tasks undertaken:
-Creation of Google Code repository.
-Connection to Google Code repository using TortoiseSVN.
-Added a readme.txt file. 

What we found out:
Code repository available through Google code and also can manage issues for our team.

Open issues/risks:
-Team members need Google accounts.
-Suitability of Subversion with Eclipse IDE was not investigated. 

Recommendations:
Google Code and Subversion are technologies that can be used to facilitate synchronization of code.

b.	Install TortoiseSVN, which will require a restart.
c.	Checkout repository: URL https://code.google.com/p/adp-fulltimers/ 
REMEMBER https not http for committing and updating code.
d.	You will need to go to the Google code web site to get a randomly generated password. This is needed to update, commit and add to the repository.
