Spike outcomes
This section captures and communicates the outcomes of the spike against each of the various goals and risks; it also outlines any open issues. In practice, this section will move to the top of the document and replace the initial goals/risks section.

Goal/Risk [these are the same as in the plan, but now additional information is added (if needed) to indicate progress made in the spike]

Example: The risk is that developers do not have sufficient confidence in Technology-Y's ability to perform well under load. The goal is to understand better how the performance of Technology-Y degrades as the number of users/transactions increases.

Tasks undertaken:
[Show only the key tasks that are likely to help another developer/reader]

* Started the test with 20 concurrent users running 5 sequential transactions, increased user load to 50 concurrent users.

What we found out:
Graph/Screen shot/outcome list/notes

Open issues/risks:
[List out the issues and risks that you have been unable to resolve at the end of the spike. You may have uncovered a whole range of new risks as well]
* Risk xyz (new)


Recommendations [Optional]:
* You may state that another spike is required to resolve new issues identified (or) indicate that this
spike has increased the teams confidence in XYZ and move on.
