Week 3 
17 - 23 August 2006
Contribution 
Two meetings were held to establish user stories and various models and I attended both taking full part in discussions. I also managed the write up of the submission and took the photos for the blog.

Individual learning (new techniques/technologies/practices that you have picked up)
The experience in applying some of the modelling techniques was useful.

What are you currently working on? 
Assignment 4 – putting together the user stories and models.

What do you plan to work on next? 
The coming week I am completing the first spike and am concentrating on understanding what JFreeChart is and how to use it.

What are the issues that you currently face? 
None

Areas you are struggling with (Knowledge/Skill/Technology gaps, People/Time issues).
Modelling concepts could be somewhat better.

Reflection on the project (no bullet points for this area)
	Project as a team has only just commenced, hence we are in the feeling out stage as a team. Some very quiet members which should change as the project continues. I felt our submission for Assignment 4 was a little light

Week 4 
23 - 30 August 2006
Contribution 
Spike completion was this week’s task. I have successfully investigated JFreeChart and shown that it is simple to use and provides the capability that we need.

Individual learning (new techniques/technologies/practices that you have picked up)
Through completing the task I needed to make more use of a java IDE. I chose to use Sun Enterprise Studio as I wanted a simple GUI designer, so am now more familiar with the general java world

What are you currently working on? 
Spike 1 was the main topic for this week, hence I developed a small application that showed the creation of different types, displayed these charts on the screen and saved them to file.

What do you plan to work on next?
There are still a few items to tidy up on Spike 1. I would like to implement Ant to build the library source code, and hence have a local copy of the API documentation.
Spike 2 will involve looking at byte code reading.

What are the issues that you currently face? None

Areas you are struggling with (Knowledge/Skill/Technology gaps, People/Time issues) 
Learning – not struggling

Reflection on the project 
The spike has done exactly what it was intended – clear up some of the mysteries. The two areas I had no idea as to how we would approach them was creating charts and reading byte code. The charting is now very clear – and a lot simpler than I had imagined. Spike 2 should clear up the byte code reading
