WEEKLY PROJECT DIARY 2006-09-20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT CONTRIBUTION:

Populated Subversion SCM repository with initial structure.
Populated back log with work items and create associated issue-register items to track status.
Migrated individual spikes and documentation from the team Wiki into the SCM.
Scanned and distributed user story analysis documentation.


INDIVIDUAL LEARNING:

Gained experience working with Google Code and its Subversion repository.
Installed and configured Eclipse to use Subversion via the Subclipse Plug-in.


CURRENT WORK:

Writing an ANT script for the project build.  This will be the first development automation step.


PLANNED WORK:

Complete ANT script and then embark on any outstanding items in backlog.
I am hoping to have time this week to continue spiking areas of the metrics library.


CURRENT ISSUES:

The team was down to three members this week, which will impair the group velocity.


PROJECT DIFFICULTIES:

	Knowledge/Skill/Technology Gaps:

	* Knowledge Gap for Metrics Library (still outstanding)

	People/Time issues:

	* I remain very busy at work, which looks like it will become worse during the next month.
	* As stated earlier, we were down to three team members this week.


PROJECT REFLECTION:

In a matter of two shorts weeks things have started to slip on the project schedule.
And there is still no collaborative information on the team wiki, other than the information I have uploaded.

WEEKLY PROJECT DIARY 2006-09-27
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT CONTRIBUTION:

Migrated project work items into issue register - I held off completely this last week until we could discuss this strategy as a team.
Updated project structure and created initial build ant script functionality.
I won't be able to check this in until tomorrow as I am waiting for team comfirmation about the versioning of tools such as ANT.


INDIVIDUAL LEARNING:

Created SVN server at work for local versioning.
Installed TortoiseSVN onto two workstations - this product has matured wonderfully in the past few years.


CURRENT WORK:

Continue adding ant tasks to automate the project build.


PLANNED WORK:

Review and identity any issues breaking the build process (compile and tests at this stage)
If time is available, then I will most likely work on Release Documentation for Iteration 1.


CURRENT ISSUES:

No current issues - the team will hopefully make up ground now that things seem to be running smoothly.


PROJECT DIFFICULTIES:

	Knowledge/Skill/Technology Gaps:

	* None affecting my current workload

	People/Time issues:

	* None


PROJECT REFLECTION:

SVN has impressed me this week, and has improved much since I last had a chance to evaluate it.
Many of the plugins and supporting tools (such as TortoiseSVN have also improved)
On the project front, I believe the team has allocated the work items for this iteration well.
Hopefully, we will have a valid release for interation 1.

WEEKLY PROJECT DIARY 2006-10-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT CONTRIBUTION:

Updated project issue register to address issues with source code.
Created ANT build to clean, compile and test project source code.
Added additional steps to run release build, which includes generating documentation, jaring and archiving.
Created synchronisation batch file to allow developers to update libraries dependencies.
Ideally this would be done via an ANT task, but in this case the script would be updating the ANT runtime.
Recreate Eclipse project using correct file locations for source code.
Fix source code checked into SVN so that it uses project structure.


INDIVIDUAL LEARNING:

Learning differences between Java ANT and NANT.  Still troubleshooting issue with ANT 1.65 ignoring commandline target - this was working under ANT 1.7b2.


CURRENT WORK:

Need to schedule team meeting as we are rapidly getting nowhere.


PLANNED WORK:

Update to ANT 1.7b2 unless I can identify why the target is ignored.
If time is available, then I will most likely work on Release Documentation for Iteration 1.


CURRENT ISSUES:

No current issues - the team will hopefully make up ground now that things seem to be running smoothly.


PROJECT DIFFICULTIES:

	Knowledge/Skill/Technology Gaps:

	* ANT 1.65 seems to ignore command line target - only seems to run default target.  It works as expected in ANT1.7b2

	People/Time issues:

	* We seem have have achieved very little work these past weeks.
	* A combined 80 hours of effort seems to have produced about 20 hours worth of results.


PROJECT REFLECTION:

Despite last weeks team meeting where work was allocated - we seem to have completed very little of the tasks.
I don't see how we can complete next weeks tasks if we are so far behind schedule.

PROJECT CONTRIBUTION:

Synchronising Team Communication.


INDIVIDUAL LEARNING:

More information on integrating Eclipse and ANT.
PMD integration into the build process (partial).
EMMA integration into the build process.


CURRENT WORK:

Running project iteration builds and managing build process integration.
Troubleshooting development team issues.


PLANNED WORK:

Extend analysis performed by PMD and Emma code-toolkits.


CURRENT ISSUES:

We are behind schedule, but hopefully we will be provided with an time extension.


PROJECT DIFFICULTIES:

	Knowledge/Skill/Technology Gaps:

	* Emma Test Coverage Tool
	* Emma-ANT build integration
	* PMD-ANT build integration

	People/Time issues:

	* Have had contact from missing team member.


PROJECT REFLECTION:

By establishing a functional and automated build process, I feel that I can better track development issues.
So while we are still behind, I think that team members will be able to spot problems better.
