= Version 1.0 Functionality =

The first version is a translation to java language, mantaining qwikioffice philosophy, and is prepared to include desktop configuration into the database.


= Requeriments =

  * An aplication server which support java server pages (Tomcat, JBoss, Grassfish)
  * JSEE 1.5 version or higest.
  * Extjs 2.0 minimum.
  * Database jdbc connector for MySQL (you have to decide which database you'll use)

= In progress =

This version doesn't save desktop configuration into the database, is prepared to manage desktop configuration, load sample modules.

At this time  I'm working to include a java class to manage load modules, load preference data and save all preferences changes into the database. 

With previous changes, I hope to have a stable version mantaining basic functionality and will be prepared to include more modules,

  * *Admin Users* 
  * *Admin Modules*, install new modules into desktop.
