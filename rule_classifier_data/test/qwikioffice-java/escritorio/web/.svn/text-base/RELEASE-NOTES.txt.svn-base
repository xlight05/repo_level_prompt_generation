Updates made involving Modules on Demand functionality.
A module is now declared in a file like the following:

  QoDesk.AccordionWindow = Ext.extend(Ext.app.Module, {
     moduleType : 'demo',
     moduleId : 'demo-acc',
     menuPath : 'StartMenu',
     launcher : {
        iconCls: 'acc-icon',
        shortcutIconCls: 'demo-acc-shortcut',
        text: 'Accordion Window',
        tooltip: '<b>Accordion Window</b><br />A window with an accordion layout'
     }
  });
  
  This file is loaded at start up.  When a module is loaded on demand, it's override
  file is loaded.  The override file looks like the following:
  
  Ext.override(QoDesk.AccordionWindow, {

     createWindow : function(){
        ...
     },
     
     ...
