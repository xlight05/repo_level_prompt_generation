----------
Foreward
Some of these arguments may or may not be correct -- they are written to the best of my knowledge.
Some of these functions may or may not get called -- some might be obsoleted based on how they are called. The finest example of this is the Self and Recieve set of functions. You're best to verify which works before using either of them.
There are alternatives if one doesn't work.

In cases where there are arguments like 'tookDamage' and 'hitter,' you may want to verify both of them before doing anything. Please let me know if you find any misleading argument names so they can be changed.

SPECIAL REFERENCES

spell -- a reference to the spell this is attached to
bot -- a reference to the bot, to make it speak or get data from it.
